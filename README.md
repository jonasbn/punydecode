# punydecode

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/jonasbn/punydecode/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/jonasbn/punydecode)

A simple CLI tool to decode a punycode encoded string

## Usage

Decoding a single string, meaning conversion from punycode to human readable text

```bash
punydecode xn--blbrgrd-fxak7p
```

Will emit

```text
blåbærgrød
```

As an alternative to provided arguments, you can pipe text into `punyencode`

```bash
echo xn--blbrgrd-fxak7p | punydecode
```

Will emit

```text
blåbærgrød
```

## Installation

Installation is easy using Go

```bash
go install github.com/jonasbn/punydecode@latest
```

If you want a particular version, please see [Go Modules Reference][MOD]

## Description

## Motivation

This utility was created, when in the process of learning Go. I have worked in the DNS and domain name business for a decade so it was only natural to work on something I know when learning Go.

This particular repository touched the following topics:

1. Learning to make CLI tools
1. Making an executable distributable and installable component
1. Reading data from the CLI
1. Reading data from STDIN
1. Testing a CLI tool / Main function in Go

See the resources and references below for resources on the above topics.
